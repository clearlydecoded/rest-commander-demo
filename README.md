## See the Demo App LIVE now

Go to [https://rest-messenger-demo.herokuapp.com/process](https://rest-messenger-demo.herokuapp.com/process) and feel free to play around with sending messages to the server.

**Note of caution:** the app is deployed on a free tier virtual machine so the very first request for the URL may be slow because it needs to wake up the virtual machine it's deployed to. This is not an indication of slowness of the framework. ðŸ˜€
